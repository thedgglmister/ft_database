# ft_database
A database management system built from scratch

### --Project Description--

The goal of ft_datebase is to create a functional database management system that can be used to create, remove, update, and display user data. No additional libraries are allowed, so the serialization and deserialization of data must be fully implemented within the program. In addtion, a custom query language and parser must be created for the user to direct the database management system from stdin.

The allowed functions are : ```exit, open, close, read, write, malloc and free```.

The Project is written in C and in accordance with "The Norm".

### --The Norm--

    • Functions must not exceed 25 lines
    • No more than 5 function-definitions in a .c file
    • One instruction per line
    • One single variable declaration per line; cannot stick declaration and initialisation on the same line
    • No more than 5 variables per bloc
    • No more than 4 parameters per function
    • Forbidden keywords are: [for] [do ... while] [switch] [case] [goto]
